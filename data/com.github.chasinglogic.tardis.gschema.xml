      <summary>Compress Backups</summary>
      <description>
        After backup has completed syncing compress it as a GZipped
        tar file. Note that this often makes backups take much longer
        and the disk will still be required to have enough space to
        hold the backup uncompressed.

        <description>
            Before creating a new backup snapshot the existing
            backup. It will be compressed and stored with the date it
            was taken. If this would make the total number of
            snapshots greater than maximum-snapshots then the oldest
            snapshot will be deleted.
